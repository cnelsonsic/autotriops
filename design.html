<h1>AutoTriops</h1>
<p>An automatic triops growing system.</p>
<p>Triops only have a few very basic needs: Food, Warmth, Oxygen, Light and Clean Water.<br />(In that order.)</p>
<p>You can start with a cold, dark tank of triops and get by,<br />or you can add these to your tank and have happier, longer lived triops.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<h3>Food Dispenser</h3>
<p>Screw inserted into tube, turned from the blunt end by stepper motor.</p>
<pre>
 | m |
 |_T_|
  |||

m = motor
T = top of screw
| = walls of hopper/tube or screw body
</pre>



<p>Which augers food down into the water from a reserve of fry food.<br />Can also narrow the tube to also crush food as it's fed into the tank.</p>
<h2>Heat</h2>
<h3>Incandescent Lamp</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Nocturnal-Infrared-Incandescent/dp/B000255OU4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368723638&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=heat+lamp+bulb">An example infrared incandescent heat lamp bulb.</a></p>
<p>An infrared heating lamp is important so that your source of heat does not interfere with your source of light.</p>
<p>It will allow you to heat and light your triops independently.<br />This means that if it gets really cold at night in your home,<br />you can heat your tank without disrupting their day/night cycle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use a heating mat under the tank, or some other source of warmth.</p>
<p>It is important to bring your tank up to temperature correctly,<br />otherwise temperatures may spike and real,<br />nearby temperatures will be far outside your poor triops' tolerances.<br />That is, they'll cook.</p>

<h2>Oxygen</h2>
<h3>Air Pump</h3>
<p>It's important that you get a large enough pump, but without creating uncomfortable currents in your tank.<br />A 10-gallon pump should suffice.</p>
<p>The point of the pump is to<br />generate very fine, gentle bubbles so as not to disturb your triops,<br />as well as break the surface of the water to disrupt any biofilm present,<br />and to promote oxygen dissolving into the surface of the water.</p>

<h2>Light</h2>
<h3>LED Lamp</h3>
<p>Triops evolved outdoors, in summer, where a 12-hour day/night cycle is likely best.</p>
<p>As such, the light produced should be daylight spectrum.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?rh=n%3A228013%2Cn%3A495266%2Cn%3A322525011%2Cn%3A2314207011%2Ck%3Adaylight%2Cp_n_condition-type%3A6358196011%2Cp_72%3A1248909011&amp;keywords=daylight&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368728959&amp;rnid=1248907011">Some sample LED bulbs.</a></p>
<h2>Water</h2>
<h3>Filter</h3>
<p>Sucks air through an assembly that sucks water through a biochemical sponge and filters your water through it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aquarium-Biochemical-Sponge-Filter-Fish/dp/B0056XVF82/ref=sr_1_1?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368842300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Aquarium+Biochemical+Sponge+Filter">You'll want something like this.</a></p>
<p>You hook your air pump up to that and it will serve the same purpose as the diffuser stone above.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can use an under-gravel filter, but these are less than ideal.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lees-Economy-Undergravel-Filer-Plate/dp/B0002APV7U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368735467&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=undergravel+filter+10+gallon">A sample undergravel filter.</a></p>
<h3>Dirty Water Outflow Siphon</h3>
<p>Handles outgoing, old water for water changes.</p>
<p>This is just a valve on a primed siphon that draws water out of the tank<br />and into a reservoir below the tank.</p>

<h3>Clean Water Inflow Siphon</h3>
<p>Adds water to the tank after a water change or as needed.</p>
<p>This is just a valve on a primed siphon that draws water out of the reservoir of clean, fresh water at a higher elevation<br />and drains it into the tank.</p>
